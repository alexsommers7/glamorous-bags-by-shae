Local, small business website created with pure HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, and NPM. Hosted on Netlify with form data handled through Netlify.

Uses Crypto-JS (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.9-1/crypto-js.min.js) to encrypt the passcode. The authentication status is stored in a cookie for a duration of 3 days. The client was offered the option of using the netlify site protection feature for $19/month, but opted for this less secure, custom method to save cost. Their desire was to keep the average person from gaining access to the site and provide an "exclusive" feel to it. Given that sensitive data is not being stored, I obliged to the client's request while alerting them that there are ways around this method, including but not limited to disabling javascript.
